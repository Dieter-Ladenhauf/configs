# dotfiles

This repository contains most of my customized config files for various Linux programs which I use on a daily basis. It aims to document all the stuff which I configured on my local system and prevents me from re-configuring everything manually once I setup a new computer.

Currently, the config files for these programs are already listed:

- [x] bash
- [x] vim
- [x] nvim
- [x] i3
- [x] git

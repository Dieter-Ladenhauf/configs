# Welcome to my config cheat sheets

This repository contains most of my customized config files for various Linux programs which I use on a daily basis. It aims to document all the stuff which I configured on my local system. It prevents that I have to re-configuring everything manually once I setup a new computer.

Currently the config files for these programs are already listed:
- [x] bash
- [x] vim
- [x] nvim
- [x] i3

Currently missing
- [ ] git

Future ideas
- [ ] Create a bash script which automatically sets up everything
